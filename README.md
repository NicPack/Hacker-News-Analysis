# Hacker-News-Analysis

That is another guided project from the DataQuest Data Analyst career path. This time though, is more independent and I was just given tast sequence hints. The aim of this project is to practice my work with strings and dates and times. **I also extended the task and added my non-guided part**.

### In the guided part of the project i checked if:
- Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?
- Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?

### In the non-guided part:
In the non-guided part I explored the dataset a little bit more and checked few thesis:

- determine if show or ask posts receive more points on average
- determine if posts created at a cerain time are more likely to receive more points
- compare the results to the average number of comments and points other posts receive
